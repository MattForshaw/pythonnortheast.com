Phil Jeffes - of Coding Club fame - will be using his fantastic teaching skills to help us make applications talk to each other using ZeroMQ!

During the evening we will explore the basics of Inter Process Communication (IPC) and then build a Python app to interact with a text adventure application running on the same machine, using ZeroMQ.

This will include a Dojo so make sure you bring your laptops!

As always, pizza will be sponsored by the incredible Sharpe Recruitment and Pebble! Donâ€™t forget to sign up to secure your slice!
